# SIMD-CUDA-optimization
The stencil problem is one of the most important kernels in diverse application scenarios, such as physical simulations, ML, and scientific computing. This project explores the optimization of a sub-class of the stencil problem using SIMD intrinsics and OpenMP. We also explore CUDA solutions for Sparse Matrix Vector Multiplication.
